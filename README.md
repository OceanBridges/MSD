This code uses txt data to calculate the mean square displacement of particle trajectories. If you use this code, you need to pay attention to the order of the columns in your txt file: Time, Particle index, X, Y.

Once the mean square displacement has been calculated, it will be plotted in 2 different graphs.
The first graph represents the MSD as a function of time Tau, for each of the particles. The second plot shows the MSD as a function of time Tau for the average particle trajectory. 

Please note that these graphs do not show the MSD logarithm.
